# Personal Site

My personal website — projects, experiments, and a slightly opinionated “hacker view” of things I build.

**Live:**  
👉 https://william-t-christie.github.io/personal-site/

---

## What this is
A lightweight personal site built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
No frameworks, no build step, no dependencies — just files that load fast and do exactly what they’re supposed to.

This repo doubles as:
- a portfolio
- a sandbox for small ideas
- a place to ship without overengineering

---

## Sections
- **Home** — intro + links  
- **Projects** — short, honest writeups (no VC buzzwords unless ironic)  
- **Hacker View** — stripped-down, functional presentation  
- **Design Experiments** — color palettes, layout comparisons, UI tests  

---

## Featured projects
- **Buzzword Bingo** — a survival game for meetings that should’ve been emails  
- **LinkSmith** — keeps links and citations organized so future-me doesn’t suffer  
- **Tab Guilt** — makes you feel bad about your browser tabs (morally correct)

## Deployment
Deployed via **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch.

If something looks broken:
1. Check the commit
2. Refresh the page
3. Remember browsers cache aggressively

---

## Why no framework?
- Faster load times  
- Fewer abstractions  
- Easier experimentation  
- More fun  

Frameworks are great. This site doesn’t need one.

If you’re here from GitHub: welcome.  
If you’re here from my resume: yes, I actually built this.
